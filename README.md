# Book Genre Detector using traditional ML Models as well as Deep Learning and NLP

## Preprocessing

Two datasets were found for the development of the project: BooksDataSet.csv from [GitHub](https://github.com/chikne97/Book-Genre-Prediction/tree/master) and booksummaries.txt from [CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbamman/booksummaries.html). The first dataset is a preprocessed version of the second.

In a first pass through the models, the first model resulted incomplete to be used for deep learning for having only 500 samples per category, so some processing was made in the first dataset to add samples.




Started with BooksDataSet but too low data 
High Precision on Models
